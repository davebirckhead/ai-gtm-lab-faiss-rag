# Track A - B2B Sales Engineer Assistant

This project is a prototype AI-powered Sales Engineer Assistant for B2B go-to-market teams. It is designed to help sales engineers, account executives, or solution consultants quickly assemble enablement packets tailored to target accounts.

The assistant uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to ingest and reason over:
- Case studies
- Security documentation
- Example contracts
- Product FAQs
- Sales collateral

## Use Case
The assistant is optimized for sales conversations around enterprise Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) like mParticle or Uniphore. It supports target personas such as:
- Heads of Marketing Technology
- IT Managers
- Procurement and Security leads
